<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
    This is a "base template" - when making HTML pages for a website, you might use
    a lot of the same formatting or data. For example, the title of this web app
    might always be "Flask Demo", so we include it in the base template. However,
    the body (or content) of the page will differ depending on the route.

    This is where Jinja2's "Template Inheritance" comes into play - creating a
    "block" allows you to set aside a block of HTML code that will change depending
    on which HTML page you render.

    Visit the "Extend Child Templates" section in the Jinja2 Primer
    (https://realpython.com/primer-on-jinja-templating/) to read more.
