<!--
    This is a "base template" - when making HTML pages for a website, you might use
    a lot of the same formatting or data. For example, the title of this web app
    might always be "Flask Demo", so we include it in the base template. However,
    the body (or content) of the page will differ depending on the route.

    This is where Jinja2's "Template Inheritance" comes into play - creating a
    "block" allows you to set aside a block of HTML code that will change depending
    on which HTML page you render.

    Visit the "Extend Child Templates" section in the Jinja2 Primer
    (https://realpython.com/primer-on-jinja-templating/) to read more.

        You can add CSS stylesheets to an HTML document. Use double curly braces
        along with the url_for() function, passing in 'static' along with the
        filename of the CSS file to link. Note that there must be a "static"
        folder in the same directory as the main application this HTML file is
        rendered from.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='index.css') }}">

        You can add Google fonts to an HTML document - go to "fonts.google.com"
        and look up a font type that you'd like to use. They will provide the
        necessary HTML and CSS lines that you'd need to add in order to use
        that specific family.
